/* 

I was trying to mimic the :hover response created with a mouse cursor on the screen, 
to work on a touchscreen using Javascript. It wasn't working.
I erased the event listener code in the html document.

I'm studying Javascript.
When I figure out what went wrong, I'll come back to fix it.
Hopefully by October.
